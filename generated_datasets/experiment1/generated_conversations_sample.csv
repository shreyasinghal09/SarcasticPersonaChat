User 2: That sounds fun! I love swimming too.
User 1: Me too! I live right by the beach, so I get to swim every day.
User 2: That's so lucky! I live in a landlocked state, so I only get to swim in the summer.

User 2: I usually watch TV or read. I've been trying to get through ""War and Peace"" lately.

User 1: That's quite the undertaking! I've heard it's a great book, but it's a long one.

User 2: It is! I'm only on page 200.

User 1: Wow, you're making great progress! I've always admired people who can read long books. I'm more of a short story kind of person myself.

User 2: I used to be too, but I've been trying to expand my horizons.

User 1: That's a noble goal. I've been meaning to read ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" for years, but I just can't seem to get around to it.

User 2: That's a classic! You should definitely make time for it.

User 1: I will, I promise. I just need to find the time.
